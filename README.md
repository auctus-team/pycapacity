## What is ``pycapacity``?

Python package ``pycapacity`` provides a set of tools for evaluating task space physical ability metrics for humans and robots, based on polytopes and ellipsoids. 
The aim of ``pycapacity`` is to provide a set of efficient tools for their evaluation in an easy to use framework that can be easily integrated with standard robotics 
and biomechanics libraries. The package implements several state of the art algorithms for polytope evaluation that bring many of the 
polytope metrics to the few milliseconds evaluation time, making it possible to use them in online and interactive applications. 

The package can be easily interfaced with standard libraries for robotic manipulator rigid body simulation such as ``robotic-toolbox`` 
or ``pinocchio``, as well as human musculoskeletal model biomechanics 
softwares ``opensim`` and ``biorbd``. The package can also be used with the Robot Operating System (``ROS``).

The package additionally implements a set of visualization tools for polytopes and ellipsoids based on the
Python package ``matplotlib`` intended for fast prototyping and quick and interactive visualization.

## Robotic manipulator capacity metrics
<img src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/auctus-team/pycapacity/master/images/robot.png' height='300px'>

For the robotic manipulators the package integrates several velocity, force and acceleration capacity calculation functions based on ellipsoids:
- Velocity (manipulability) ellipsoid <br> `E_vel = {dx | dx = J.dq, ||dq||<1 }`
- Acceleration (dynamic manipulability) ellipsoid <br> `E_acc = {ddx | ddx = J.M^(-1).t, ||t||<1 }`
- Force ellipsoid <br> `E_for = {f | J^T.f = t, ||t||<1 }`

And polytopes: 
- Velocity polytope <br> `P_vel = {dx | dx = J.dq,  dq_min < dq < dq_max}`
- Acceleration polytope <br> `P_acc = {ddx | ddx = J.M^(-1).t, t_min < t < t_max}`
- Force polytope <br> `P_for = {f | J^T.f = t, t_min < t < t_max}`
- **NEW** ðŸ“¢: Reachable space of the robot with the horizon `T`  <br> `P_x = {x | x = JM(-1)tT^2/2, t_min < t < t_max,   dq_min < M^(-1)tT < dq_max,   q_min < M^(-1)tT^2/2 < q_max}`
- Force polytopes *Minkowski sum and intersection*

Where `J` is the robot jacobian matrix, `f` is the vector of cartesian forces,`dx` and `ddx` are vectors fo cartesian velocities and accretions, `dq` is the vector of the joint velocities and `t` is the vector of joint torques.

Reachable space polytope approximation is based on this paper: <br>
[**Approximating robot reachable space using convex polytopes**](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.17054.pdf)<br> by Skuric, Antun, Vincent Padois, and David Daney. <br> In: Human-Friendly Robotics 2022: HFR: 15th International Workshop on Human-Friendly Robotics. Cham: Springer International Publishing, 2023.

The force polytope functions have been implemented according to the paper:<br>
[**On-line force capability evaluation based on efficient polytope vertex search**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.05226)<br> 
by A.Skuric, V.Padois and D.Daney<br> Published on ICRA2021

## Human musculoskeletal models capacity metrics
<img src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/auctus-team/pycapacity/master/images/force.png' height='200px'>

For the human musculoskeletal models this package implements the ellipsoid and polytope evaluation functions. The implemented ellipsoids are:
- Velocity (manipulability) ellipsoid <br> `E_vel = {dx | dx = J.dq, dl = L.dq, ||dl||<1 }`
- Acceleration (dynamic manipulability) ellipsoid <br> `E_acc = {ddx | ddx = J.M^(-1).N.F, ||F||<1 }`
- Force ellipsoid <br> `E_for = {f | J^T.f = N.F, ||F||<1 }`

And polytopes: 
- Velocity polytope <br> `P_vel = {dx | dx = J.dq, dl = L.dq  dl_min < dl < dl_max}`
- Acceleration polytope <br> `P_acc = {ddx | ddx = J.M^(-1).N.F, F_min < F < F_max}`
- Force polytope <br> `P_for = {f | J^T.f = N.F, F_min < F < F_max}`

Where `J` is the model's jacobian matrix, `L` si the muscle length jacobian matrix, `N= -L^T` is the moment arm matrix, `f` is the vector of cartesian forces,`dx` and `ddx` are vectors fo cartesian velocities and accretions, `dq` is the vector of the joint velocities, `t` is the vector of joint torques, `dl` is the vector of the muscle stretching velocities and `F` is the vector of muscular forces. 

The force and velocity polytope functions have been implemented according to the paper:<br>
[**On-line feasible wrench polytope evaluation based on human musculoskeletal models: an iterative convex hull method**](https://hal.inria.fr/hal-03369576)<br> 
by A.Skuric, V.Padois, N.Rezzoug and D.Daney<br> Submitted to RAL & ICRA2022 

And the acceleration polytopes are resolved using the *Hyper-plane shifting method*:<br>
[**Characterization of Parallel Manipulator Available Wrench Set Facets**](http://www.lirmm.fr/krut/pdf/2010_gouttefarde_ark-0602650368/2010_gouttefarde_ark.pdf)<br>

## Polytope evaluation algorithms

There are three methods implemented in this paper to resolve all the polytope calculations:
- Hyper-plane shifting method (HPSM)
- Iterative convex hull method (ICHM)
- Vertex enumeration algorithm (VEPOLI2)

All of the methods are implemented in the module `pycapacity.algorithms` and can be used as standalone functions.  See in [docs for more info](https://auctus-team.github.io/pycapacity/pycapacity.algorithms.html#). 

### Hyper-plane shifting method (HPSM)

[**Characterization of Parallel Manipulator Available Wrench Set Facets**](http://www.lirmm.fr/krut/pdf/2010_gouttefarde_ark-0602650368/2010_gouttefarde_ark.pdf)<br>
by Gouttefarde M., Krut S. <br>In: Lenarcic J., Stanisic M. (eds) Advances in Robot Kinematics: Motion in Man and Machine. Springer, Dordrecht (2010)

This method finds the half-space representation of the polytope of a class:
```
P = {x | x = By, y_min <= y <= y_max }
```
To find the vertices of the polytope after finding the half-space representation `Hx <= d` an convex-hull algorithm is used. 

The method is a part of the `pycapacity.algorithms` module `hyper_plane_shift_method`, See in [docs for more info](https://auctus-team.github.io/pycapacity/pycapacity.algorithms.html#pycapacity.algorithms.hyper_plane_shift_method). 

### Iterative convex-hull method (ICHM)
[**On-line feasible wrench polytope evaluation based on human musculoskeletal models: an iterative convex hull method**](https://hal.inria.fr/hal-03369576)<br> 
by A.Skuric, V.Padois, N.Rezzoug and D.Daney<br> Submitted to RAL & ICRA2022 

This method finds both vertex and half-space representation of the class of polytopes:
```
P = {x | Ax = By, y_min <= y <= y_max }
``` 
And it can be additionally extended to the case where there is an additional projection matrix `P` making a class of problems:
```
P = {x | x= Pz, Az = By, y_min <= y <= y_max }
``` 

The method is a part of the `pycapacity.algorithms` module `iterative_convex_hull_method`. See the [docs for more info](https://auctus-team.github.io/pycapacity/pycapacity.algorithms.html#pycapacity.algorithms.iterative_convex_hull_method)

### Vertex enumeration algorithm (VEPOLI2)
[**On-line force capability evaluation based on efficient polytope vertex search**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.05226)<br> 
by A.Skuric, V.Padois and D.Daney<br> Published on ICRA2021

This method finds vertex representation of the class of polytopes:
```
P = {x | Ax = y, y_min <= y <= y_max }
``` 
To find the half-space representation (faces) of the polytope after finding the vertex representation  an convex-hull algorithm is used. 

The method is a part of the `pycapacity.algorithms` module `vertex_enumeration_vepoli2`. See the [docs for more info](https://auctus-team.github.io/pycapacity/pycapacity.algorithms.html#pycapacity.algorithms.vertex_enumeration_vepoli2)
