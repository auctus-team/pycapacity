What is ``pycapacity``?
------------------------------------

Python package ``pycapacity`` provides a set of tools for evaluating task space physical ability metrics for humans and robots, based on polytopes and ellipsoids. 
The aim of ``pycapacity`` is to provide a set of efficient tools for their evaluation in an easy to use framework that can be easily integrated with standard robotics 
and biomechanics libraries. The package implements several state of the art algorithms for polytope evaluation that bring many of the 
polytope metrics to the few milliseconds evaluation time, making it possible to use them in online and interactive applications. 

The package can be easily interfaced with standard libraries for robotic manipulator rigid body simulation such as ``robotic-toolbox`` 
or ``pinocchio``, as well as human musculoskeletal model biomechanics 
softwares ``opensim`` and ``biorbd``. The package can also be used with the Robot Operating System (``ROS``).

The package additionally implements a set of visualization tools for polytopes and ellipsoids based on the
Python package ``matplotlib`` intended for fast prototyping and quick and interactive visualization.

Implemented metrics
------------------------------------

This package implements polytope and ellipsoid based physical ability metrics for robotic manipulators and human musculoskeletal models.

For the robotic manipulators the package integrates several velocity, force and acceleration capacity calculation functions based on ellipsoids:

- Velocity (manipulability) ellipsoid  

    .. math:: E_{v} = \{\dot{x} ~| \dot{x} = J\dot{q},~ ||W^{-1}\dot{q}||\leq1 \}, \qquad W = diag(\dot{q}_{max})
- Acceleration (dynamic manipulability) ellipsoid  

    .. math:: E_{a} = \{\ddot{x} ~| \ddot{x} = JM^{-1}\tau,~ ||W^{-1}\tau||\leq1 \}, \qquad W = diag(\tau_{max})
- Force ellipsoid 

    .. math:: E_{f} = \{{f} ~| J^{T}f = \tau,~ ||W^{-1}\tau||\leq1 \}, \qquad W = diag(\tau_{max})

And polytopes: 

- Velocity polytope  

    .. math:: P_{v} = \{\dot{x} ~| \dot{x} = J\dot{q},~ \dot{q}_{min}\leq\dot{q}\leq\dot{q}_{max} \}
- Acceleration polytope 

    .. math:: P_{a} = \{\ddot{x} ~| \ddot{x} = JM^{-1}\tau,~ \tau_{min}\leq\tau\leq\tau_{max} \}
- Force polytope  

    .. math:: P_{f} = \{f ~| J^{T}f = \tau,~ \tau_{min}\leq\tau\leq\tau_{max} \}
- Force polytopes *Minkowski sum and intersection*  

    .. math::  P_{\cap} = \mathcal{P}_{f1} \cap \mathcal{P}_{f1} \qquad P_{\oplus} = \mathcal{P}_{f1} \oplus \mathcal{P}_{f1} 

Where :math:`J` is the robot jacobian matrix, :math:`f` is the vector of cartesian forces, :math:`\dot{x}` and :math:`\ddot{x}` are vectors fo cartesian velocities and accretions, :math:`\dot{q}` is the vector of the joint velocities and :math:`\tau` is the vector of joint torques.

- New 📢 : Reachable space approximation of in the desired horizon of interest :math:`\Delta t_{h}` using the convex polytope formulation:

    .. math::  P_x = \{\Delta x~ |~ \Delta{x} = JM^{-1}\tau \Delta t_{h}^2/2,
    .. math:: {\tau}_{min} \leq \tau \leq {\tau}_{max},
    .. math::  \dot{q}_{min} \leq M^{-1}\tau \Delta t_{h}  \leq \dot{q}_{max},
    .. math::  {q}_{min} \leq M^{-1}\tau \Delta t_{h}^2/2  \leq {q}_{max} \}

Performance evaluation of polytope metrics
---------------------------------------------

The applicable methods to evaluate different polytope based metrics depend on the family of problems they correspond to. 
Therefore this section brings the information about which algorithm is used for which polytope 
metric and provides a brief performance evaluation their execution times.

The average execution time is calculated using 7 dof Franka Emika panda robot, the model was used with ``pinocchio`` software. 
All the experiments are run on a computer equipped with 1.90GHz Intel i7-8650U processor. The results are obtained using 
the benchmarking script provided in the ``examples`` folder, `script link <https://github.com/auctus-team/pycapacity/blob/master/examples/scripts/benchmarking/polytope_robot_performance_analysis_pinocchio.py>`_.


In case of human musculoskeletal models the methods used are given in the table below.

The average execution time was calculated using 50 muscle 7 dof musculoskeletal model introduced by Holzbaur, the model was used with ``biorbd`` biomechanics software. 
The experiments are run on a computer equipped with 1.90GHz Intel i7-8650U processor. The results are obtained using the benchmarking script 
provided in the `examples` folder, `script link <https://github.com/auctus-team/pycapacity/blob/master/examples/scripts/benchmarking/polytope_human_performance_analysis_biorbd.py>`_.

As these times can vary significantly depending on the complexity of the model used and the hardware it is run on, 
the users are encouraged to run the benchmark scripts themselves to get the most accurate results. 
This package provides several benchmarking scripts in the ``examples`` folder, see link for more 
details: `link <https://github.com/auctus-team/pycapacity/tree/master/examples/scripts/benchmarking>`_.
