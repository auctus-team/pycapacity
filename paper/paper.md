# Summary

There is a rising interest in collaborative robotics and physical human robot interaction, where the robot's are required to adapt to certain needs of the human in real-time. The fundamental challenge being the ablity to evaluate the need of assistance of the operator. One of ways to quantify the need of assistance is by evaluating the operator's physical abilities in real-time and comparing them to the required physical abilities required by the collaborative task. Then the robot can assit the operator where he lacks the physical ability to accomplish the task.

Furthermore, as todays collaborative robotic manipulators are designed for safety, their performance characteristics are relatively limited with respect to the more standard industrial robots. Therefore it is becoming increasingly important to exploit their full (physical) abilities when executing the task.  

There are many different physical ability metrics available in the literature that might be used in such way, such as: force capapcity, velocity capacity, acceleratio capacity, precition and similar. Most of these metrics can be represented by two families of geometric shapes ellipsoids [@yoshikawa1985manipulability] and polytopes [@chiacchio1997force]. However more efficient numerical tools are needed in order to evaluate these metrics in order to allow for more of their real-time applications, for example in robot control or interactive visualisaiton. Additionally efficient performance metircs can be further used for robot and workspace design as well as human motion and ergonomics analysis.

# Statement of need

Therefore this python package implements several different robotic manipulator and human musculoskeletal model based physical capacity metrics, based on ellipsoids and polytopes. All the algorihtms are implemented in python, and having execution times of a fraction of the seconds,they are intended to be used in real-time applications such as robot control and visualisation to the operator as well as in robot performance. The package can be easily interfaced with standard libraries for robotic manipulator rigid body simulation such as `robotic-toolbox` [@corke2021not]Â or `pinocchio` [@carpentier2019pinocchio], as well as human musculoskeletal model biomecanics software `opensim` [@delp2007opensim] and `biorbd` [@michaudBiorbd2021]. 

The package additionally implements a set of visualisation tools for polytopes and ellipsoids baes on the pyhton package `matplotlib` intended for fast prototyping and quick and interactive visualisation.

This package has been used in several scientific papers, for real-time control of collaborative carrying using two Franka Emika Panda robots [@Skuric2021], for developing an assist-as-needed control strategy for collaborative carrying task of the human operator and the Franka robot [@Skuric2022]. The package has been used to calculate the approaximation of the robot's reachable space using convex polytope [@skuric2023].


# Implemented algorithms

This package implements several different algorithms for polytope evaluation 

- Hyper-plane shifting method
- Vertex enumeration auctus
- Iterative Convex Hull method

These algorithms are all implemented in python and used to evaluate different polytope based physical ability metrics. Additionally the algorihtms are availible to the users to be used standalone as well.

## Hyper-plane shifting method (HPSM)

This is an algorihtm based on the paper by [@Gouttefarde2010] which presents an efficient way of determining the minimal half-space $\mathcal{H}$ representation of the polytope described by the equation 

\begin{equation}\label{eq:hpsm}
P = \{ x ~|~ x = By, \quad y_{min}\leq y \leq y_{max} \}
\end{equation}

## Vertex enumeration auctus (VEA)

This is an algorithm based on the paper by [@Skuric2021] which describes an efficient method for finding vertex $\mathcal{V}$ representation of the polytope described by the equation

\begin{equation}\label{eq:vertex_auctus}
P = \{ x ~|~ Ax = y, \quad y_{min}\leq y \leq y_{max} \}
\end{equation}


## Iterative convex-hull method (ICHM)

This is an algorihtm descirbed in the paper by [@Skuric2022] which implements an efficient method which iteratively approximates the polytope

\begin{equation}\label{eq:ichm}
P = \{ x ~|~ Ax = By, \quad y_{min}\leq y \leq y_{max} \}
\end{equation}

The method finds both vertex $\mathcal{V}$ and half-plane $\mathcal{H}$ representation of the polytope at the same time. 
  
And it can be additionally extended to the case where there is an additional projection matrix $P$ making a class of problems:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:ichm_full}
P = \{ x ~|~ x= Pz, Az = By, \quad y_{min}\leq y \leq y_{max} \}
\end{equation}





# Physical capacity metrics available

The package several implements different physical ability metrics for robotic manipulators and humans based on musculoskeletal models.

## Robotic manipulators metrics

For the robotic manipulators the package integrates several velocity, force and acceleration capacity calculation functions based on ellipsoids.

Both polytopes and ellipsoids are calculated separately for the 3D and for each of the 2D reduced task-space cases. Both polytopes and ellipsoids take in consideration the true joint torque limits provided by the manufacturer. The underestimation of the true force capabilities of the robot by ellipsoids appears clearly.](robot.png){ width=50% }

### Ellipsoids

- Velocity (manipulability) ellipsoid  
\begin{equation}\label{eq:ev_r}
E_{v} = \{\dot{x} ~| \dot{x} = J\dot{q},~ ||\dot{q}||\leq1 \}
\end{equation}

- Acceleration (dynamic manipulability) ellipsoid  
\begin{equation}\label{eq:ea_r}
E_{a} = \{\ddot{x} ~| \ddot{x} = JM^{-1}\tau,~ ||\tau||\leq1 \}
\end{equation}

- Force ellipsoid 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:ef_r}
E_{f} = \{{f} ~| J^{T}f = \tau,~ ||\tau||\leq1 \}
\end{equation}

### Polytopes

- Velocity polytope  
\begin{equation}\label{eq:pv_r}
P_{v} = \{\dot{x} ~| \dot{x} = J\dot{q},~ \dot{q}_{min}\leq\dot{q}\leq\dot{q}_{max} \}
\end{equation}

- Acceleration polytope 

\begin{equation}\label{eq:pa_r}
P_{a} = \{\ddot{x} ~| \ddot{x} = JM^{-1}\tau,~ \tau_{min}\leq\tau\leq\tau_{max} \}
\end{equation}

- Force polytope  

\begin{equation}\label{eq:pf_r}
P_{f} = \{f ~| J^{T}f = \tau,~ \tau_{min}\leq\tau\leq\tau_{max} \}
\end{equation}

- Force polytopes *Minkowski sum and intersection*  

\begin{equation}\label{eq:psi_r}
P_{\cap} = {P}_{f1} \cap {P}_{f1} \qquad P_{\oplus} = {P}_{f1} \oplus {P}_{f1} 
\end{equation}

- Reachable space approximation of in the desired horizon of interest $\Delta t_{h}$ using the convex polytope formulation 

\begin{equation}\label{eq:prs_r}
\begin{split}
P_x = \{\Delta x~ |~ \Delta{x} &= JM^{-1}\tau \frac{\Delta t_{h}^2}{2},\\
  {\tau}_{min} &\leq \tau \leq {\tau}_{max},\\
   \dot{q}_{min} &\leq M^{-1}\tau \Delta t_{h}  \leq \dot{q}_{max}, \\
  {q}_{min} &\leq M^{-1}\tau \frac{\Delta t_{h}^2}{2}  \leq {q}_{max} \}\\
  \end{split}
\end{equation}

This approach is described in the paper by [@skuric2023].


Where $J$ is the robot jacobian matrix, $f$ is the vector of cartesian forces, $\dot{x}$ and $\ddot{x}$ are vectors fo cartesian velocities and accretions, $\dot{q}$ is the vector of the joint velocities and $\tau$ is the vector of joint torques.

## Human musculoskeletal model metrics

For the human musculoskeletal models this package implements the polytope metrics:

- Velocity polytope  
\begin{equation}\label{eq:pv_h}
P_{v} = \{\dot{x} ~|~\dot{l} = L\dot{q},~ \dot{x} = J\dot{q},~ \dot{q}_{min}, ~ \leq\dot{q}\leq\dot{q}_{max}, ~\dot{l}_{min}\leq\dot{l}\leq\dot{l}_{max} \}
\end{equation}

- Acceleration polytope   
\begin{equation}\label{eq:pa_h}
 P_{a} = \{\ddot{x} ~|~ \ddot{x} = JM^{-1}NF,~ F_{min}\leq F\leq F_{max} \}
\end{equation}

- Force polytope   
\begin{equation}\label{eq:pf_h}
P_{f} = \{f ~|~ J^Tf = NF,~ F_{min}\leq F\leq F_{max} \}
\end{equation}

Where $J$ is the model's jacobian matrix, $L$ si the muscle length jacobian matrix, $N= -L^T$ is the moment arm matrix, $f$ is the vector of cartesian forces, $\dot{x}$ and $\ddot{x}$ are vectors fo cartesian velocities and accretions, $\dot{q}$ is the vector of the joint velocities, $\tau$ is the vector of joint torques, $\dot{l}$ is the vector of the muscle stretching velocities and $F$ is the vector of muscular forces.
